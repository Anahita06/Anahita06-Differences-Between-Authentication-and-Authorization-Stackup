## Understanding Authentication vs. Authorization

### Authentication: We need to Prove who we are
Authentication is like showing our ID at a security checkpoint whether in real life or in a system. It is all about proving that we are who we claim to be.

### Authorization: What are we allowed to do
Authorization, on the other hand, is all about permissions. Even if we pass the security checkpoint (authentication), we still need the permission to access certain areas which might contain confidential information (authorization).

### Is Deleting Users After Authentication a Good Idea?
Allowing any user to delete others just because theyâ€™re authenticated is poses a risk. Without any proper authorization, any user could potentially delete someone else, which could lead to serious issues and lead to major security concerns.

### How can we Improve This
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Ensures that only certain users, like admins, can delete others. This is also based on the role they possess in the particular organization.
- **Extra Confirmation:** Before deletion, we must ask for additional confirmation to prevent mistakes.

After understanding the difference between authentication and authorization, we can create a more secure application.
